# stat_service_api_processor
There is a great statistical service called OECD. As for me, its API is quite sophisticated and can be used as a good example of how APIs can be processed to transform data to different human-readable formats.
Here is my project that uses Python and Docker to transform OECD datasets to flat tables. The program is run in a container so that you do not need to worry about dependencies.
I hope you will like it ðŸ™‚
